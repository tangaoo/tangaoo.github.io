Merry Xmas guys. I am already missing you. 

It was great honor of mine to show you the charming world of Linux and
OpenSource. For me it's all about humanity, about helping people make a life
during the process of making a living.

Technology is a lot of fun when you do it the right way, then what is the
right way? 

It is for me not about learning tons of Bash skills and Vim tips in the
shortest time, it can be quit boring if you drive yourself too hard this way.
Building a knowledge base and a expertise on Linux takes time and patience, it
is the power from the bottom of your heart that will eventually take you
through. And the power is not from the tease of Money and Fame, but from the
charm of the tech itself, hacker is somebody that loves playful cleverness, as
Richard Stallman once put it. No good programmer learn to be great, they
became great by following their love and passion. So learning by doing my
friends, and for us programmers, maybe its more proper to say, learning by
PLAYING.

Follow your interest, build your skills basing on what you already know, leave
things that are toooo difficult for you to the future, and say fuckyou to
anything that bores you. Keep it simple and Let it grow. Coding for fun!

Can never forget there was once a team of 21(myself included), it was not easy
to leave QinHuangDao.
