My friend,

I am writing to comment on your <http://kanasshop.com/>. You are doing quite well
I think by making this site pretty. But here I want to give my opinion on how
we can add more beauty and reduce its unnecessary complexity. 

I take <http://www.apple.com/> as an example for good style.

### Logo

I am not with you to choose _Tux_ as logo for your shop, it is simply not
distinguishable enough from the standard tux logo. You have a character _Tao_
on that, but for me that is not related to your product. As a customer, all I
want from a site is the info of the products and services. And I will be
most satisfied if I experience the most in beauty and the least in complexity
while getting all the info I want. If a site fail to do that, it will lose my
love in the first 5 or 10 seconds. All in all, do not push content unrelated
because of your personal taste, this is also for your slogan _ZiQiangBuXi_.

A logo shall be unique, simple and preferably somewhat related to your
product. For me I need a logo suitable for different colors, because one day I
may want to change the CSS of this site and have another color scheme. The
logos of apple and ubuntu are good.

### Details

You have not add your logo to your `<head><title>`, that is detail of course, 
but _Devil Lives In Details_, the absence of this will be considered
unprofessional in the picky eyes of your potential customers.

### English Version

Nice to have a English Version of your stuff, I believe.

### Get Feedbacks

Be it a forum or a comment area, have some place for people to comment on your ideas.
[Github](http://www.github.com) founder once said on his own
[site](http://tom.preston-werner.com/), (I forget which post these words are
on), that he had long been in love of posting his ideas on web, and the
feedbacks turned out to be invaluable.

### Free Trial

Thinking about _Github.com_, I think their service module is partly the reason
for their rapid taking-off. It is that they let you to have a free trial of
their services, later you find these nice, you are apt to pay. So, if
possible, provide sth free, show people why _Open Source_ can be so much fun
on _kanasshop.com_ , maybe we won't get money, we will get least get fame, and
thus more social connections.

### Misc

I found sth [here](http://www.wordsinarow.com/design.html):

- Your website should be enjoyable. If it's not a joyride, at least it
shouldn't be unpleasant.

- Your site should give something away. There are many ways to give something
valuable to your visitors without giving away the store.

- Design your site with the search engines in mind or you won't get many
visitors

That's all for today, and let's discuss later. Wish you success, I admire your
wit and courage.

Peter
