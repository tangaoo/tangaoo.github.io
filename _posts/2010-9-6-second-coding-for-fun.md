I had my second _Coding For Fun_ last Saturday, it was nice.

I showed a driver developer how to use git, when he said since he did not
write a lot of code, git tips I gave was not very useful. But he was
interested in my `gd`&`<c-o>` trick to read Makefiles. He showed me his 
<http://www.armux.org/index.php/> and how to acquire a domain name at
<http://xinnet.com>. He was really helpful.

Since I was building my own website and blog these days, I wanted those from my peers
<http://www.vincnd.com/> is nice one.

Late in that afternoon, a big guy from Canonical gave a talk on Arm Ubuntu, I
wish stable device be available soon, that way I do not need to learn a
new platform like _Andriod_ or _iOS_, most my desktop ubuntu conf skills can be
used on my Handheld device.

Good friends, cozy place, meaningful conversations. Interested? Head for
_Beijinglug.org_, find out when is the nice one and feel free to join us.
