These days, I am learning [Ruby on Rails][ror](RoR for short).

## Because I want to do things my own way

Building my [happypeter.org][ho], basically I want to share my screencasts and
have a [HackerNews][hn]-like forum, so that people can come, see, and talk.
Ready-made things like [phpBB][bb] are far from what I wanted quite frankly,
since they have a lot of features I don't love or need.  Hey, I am a coder, so
I do not mind learning a whole new [framework][fw] and do the
code from scratch.


## So why RoR, not [Django][dj] or java?

It's all because [github][gh] (built on RoR). I love it and I also
love some other neat RoR-based tools like [showoff][sf] and [jekyll][jk] there, anyway
the whole ecosystem looked charming and promising to me as an outsider. 

So I did not give Django a try, even though I have some python experience while knows nothing about [Ruby][ry] language.

The author of RoR, [DHH][dhh], said he built this to fight against java for
programmers' happiness, productiveness, and more importantly freedom. Freedom
is sexy, thus RoR over java is a natural choice for me.  

More importantly I think, when you want to get your feet wet in a new area, it
is more than wise to find a group of smart people you can join(I already knew
some of these people even before I started learning  RoR). So now even if RoR
is not the best web framework on this planet, it's still great for me to get
access to these nice guys to guide my way. Otherwise, I would simply get lost
in the vast ocean of concepts, like html, css, restful design...

## Is it a right decision?

Yes, I was right, and it is even getting righter as my study continues.

I started with an [official guide][off], quite a good place to start from ZERO.

Then I found [RailsforZombies][rfz]. I had never seen some cooler screencasts
before. Again, it is definitely friendly for absolute beginners.

When I had the very basic concepts in hand and really wanted to do some real
code, I found [railscasts.com][rc]. __Episode 250:__ _Authentication from
Scratch_, was really a big help.

## But Be warned!

If you do not have basic command line skills, like you never heard of what a
_shell script_ is, you may have less joyful learning process. RoR is a typical
Unix toy, it gets really naughty on Windows.


BTW, knowing [git-scm][git] is also a big bonus to make the learning process
exciting.
