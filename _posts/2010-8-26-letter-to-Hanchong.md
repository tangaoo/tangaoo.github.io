hi man,

Yesterday, we talked on the line about our life and career, and I said we need
to be unique, I do only the things I love to do, but I do not think I made my
point very clear last night, so here is this letter as a explanation.

I will first suggest you read [Commencement Speech at Stanford given by Steve
Jobs](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/chat/1422863/posts). On why I choose
programming as my job, I would like to quote his words:

    Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be
    truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work, and the only way to
    do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep
    looking, and don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when
    you find it, and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as
    the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle.

Having dreams is nice, but I think that is not enough for us, we still need
love and care and friendship. You know what? I still remember all these joyful
days we had in Shijiazhang, Shanghai and Beijing. Do not forget we were once 
together fighting for our dreams.


Truthfully

Peter
